## Abstract
The race for vaccinating the whole population in Mexico, against the COVID-19, started in December 2020. With the data collected up to April 2021, provided by [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data), this research work pursues to understand and predict the vaccination progress in Mexico in order to see what can be done to catalyze this progress. The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology is applied here, to make a right problem understanding and data management, also Time Series Forecasting is applied to predict future points of the studied case. The results show a good data understanding and model forecasting with the available records, and some strategies are proposed to get more people fully vaccinated.
